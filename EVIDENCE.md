### 🆔 [E-MINUTES-2024-11-15-09] The Insurance Boycott

**🚨 Significance:**

At the end of 2024, faced with major repair works at Wang Fuk Court, nine of Hong Kong’s ten leading insurers either refused to provide a quote or did not respond. This indicates that the insurance industry—armed with the most sophisticated risk models—has effectively classified the estate as uninsurable. Only China Taiping was willing to underwrite the project.

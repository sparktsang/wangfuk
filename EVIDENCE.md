### 🆔 [E-SAFETY-2016-01-01-01] The "Mathematical Impossibility" & The Parasitic Business Model

**🚨 Significance:**

Analysis of historical bidding data reveals that **Victory Fire Engineering (宏泰)** operated a "Parasitic Business Model" for a decade, characterized by **predatory pricing** that made genuine safety inspections mathematically impossible.

**1. The Mathematical Impossibility:**
From 2016 to 2021, Victory charged a total annual fee of **$3,200** to maintain the fire systems of **8 residential towers**.
*   **The Calculation:** HK$3,200 ÷ 8 towers = **HK$400 per tower per year**.
*   **The Reality Check:** Fire safety expert Leung Kam-tak estimates a proper inspection requires at least 2 workers for 1 day, costing ~HK$3,000 in wages alone.
*   **The Conclusion:** Victory was charging **13% of the minimum labor cost**. It is impossible to conduct a genuine inspection at this price. The "Annual Inspections" were  *fictitious paper exercises*.

**2. The "Loss Leader" Trap:**
The data exposes a clear strategy: Win the maintenance contract with an absurdly low bid to gain exclusive access, then extract massive profits through "Rectification Works".
*   While charging only $3,200/year for "maintenance," Victory billed **$298,000** for repairs in 2021 and **$144,170** in 2025.
*   **Conflict of Interest:** The entity responsible for Inspection is the same entity paid to fix them. This incentivizes either (a) ignoring maintenance until systems collapse (generating big repair bills), or (b) fabricating defects.

### 🆔 [E-SAFETY-2024-11-15-01] The Insurance Boycott

**🚨 Significance:**

At the end of 2024, faced with major repair works at Wang Fuk Court, nine of Hong Kong’s ten leading insurers either refused to provide a quote or did not respond. This indicates that the insurance industry—armed with the most sophisticated risk models—has effectively classified the estate as uninsurable. Only China Taiping was willing to underwrite the project.

### 🆔 [E-SAFETY-2025-05-21-01] The 10-Month Ghost Supervisor & The "Closed-Loop" Collusion

**🚨 Significance:**

Official records expose a shocking **10-month supervision vacuum** during the most critical initial phases of the renovation, coupled with a hiring structure that creates a fundamental conflict of interest.

**1. The 10-Month Danger Gap:**
The General Contractor (**Prestige/宏業**) commenced work (Bai Shen ceremony) on **July 16, 2024**. However, the Clerk of Works (COW/工程監督) only assumed duty on **May 21, 2025**.
*   **The Reality:** For around 300 days, major works including scaffolding erection, external wall hacking, and material delivery proceeded without independent on-site supervision.
*   **The Irony:** The MC claimed in the AGM that the COW "improved engineering quality," ignoring that the foundations of the project were laid while the post was vacant.

**2. The "Incestuous" Hiring Structure:**
The COW, Mr. Wong Chin Hang, is theoretically the residents' eyes and ears. However:
*   **The Paymaster:** Residents pay the bill (HK$39,718/month).
*   **The Boss:** The Consultant (**Will Power/鴻毅**) receives the money, takes an "Admin Fee," and employs the COW.
*   **The Target:** The COW is supposed to supervise the Contractor (**Prestige/宏業**).
*   **The Conflict:** Since **Will Power** facilitated **Prestige** winning the tender (as established in previous evidence), the COW is essentially paid by the Consultant to supervise the Consultant's own preferred partner. This is a "Closed Loop" where the referee, the player, and the linesman are all on the same team.

### 🆔 [E-SAFETY-2025-09-29-01] Documentary Failures: The 'Lift Contractor' Error & The $1.7M Mislabeling

**🚨 Significance:**

Official minutes show that on 29 Sep 2025, the MC unanimously approved a fire-safety tender despite two glaring errors in the document — listing the contractors as "Lift Contractors" and misclassifying the HK$144,170 repair fee as a "Monthly Fee" — revealing a decision-making process that may not have received even basic scrutiny and raising serious doubts about the MC’s capacity to oversee critical building safety matters.

### 🆔 [E-SAFETY-2025-11-07-01] The Paralyzed Water Network & The Fatal Maintenance

**🚨 Significance:**

On November 26, 2025, during the fatal fire, the estate’s fire hose system was effectively paralyzed, with reports indicating only one hose might have functioned. This failure is directly traceable to a series of administrative decisions made just 19 days prior.

**1. The "Profit-Driven" Maintenance Logic:**
Records show that the replacement of critical water gate valves (閘掣) was prioritized **not for fire safety compliance**, but to accommodate the waterproofing works of the general contractor, **Prestige Construction (宏業)**. The Clerk of Works (COW) explicitly stated that valves needed replacing "because the General Contractor needs to stop water intake to proceed with waterproofing." This implies that if there were no waterproofing contract (profit), the aging valves might have been left to rot.

**2. The Critical Gap:**
The decision to replace these valves was finalized on **November 7, 2025**. The fire occurred on **November 26**. It is highly probable that the water supply to the fire fighting system was suspended or the valves were dismantled for this "maintenance" at the exact moment the fire broke out.

**3. Systemic Collusion & Conflict of Interest:**
*   **The Consultant (Will Power / 鴻毅):** Acted as both the building inspector and the project manager, facilitating Prestige's winning bid. 
*   **The Contractor (Prestige / 宏業):** Despite the quotes from other companies, they were awarded specific fire tank valve repairs (Item 11.5) to "avoid warranty disputes," effectively locking the MC into their ecosystem.
*   **The "Double Agent" (Wong Chin Hang / 黃展鏗):** The Clerk of Works, theoretically representing the residents but hired via the Consultant, pushed for these specific repairs that facilitated the Contractor's workflow.
*   **The Silent Watchdog (Victory Fire / 宏泰):** As the fire system maintenance contractor, they secured the renewal contract in Sept 2025. Yet, it took the *General Contractor's* need for waterproofing in Nov 2025 to identify "aging valves" that Victory's annual inspection apparently missed or ignored.

### 🆔 [E-SAFETY-2025-12-04-01] The "No Big Problem" Discrepancy & The 180-Day Safety Gap

**🚨 Significance:**

There is a clear gap between what the fire contractor, Victory Fire Engineering (宏泰消防工程有限公司), said in public and what the estate’s own records show.

**1. Public Statement (Dec 4):**
Victory said the fire system was "working normally" in March and that there were "no big problems."

**2. Internal Records (Sep 29):**
The estate listed a **$144,170 repair package** for major fire-safety parts, including:

* Fire Inlet Valves
* Hose Reel Assemblies
* Fire Bells
  These are core safety components, not cosmetic items.

**3. Direct Link:**
The documents say the September repair tender was issued **"after the Annual Inspection."**
So these problems came from the March inspection done by Victory.

**4. Long Delay:**

### 🆔 [E-SAFETY-2025-12-04-02] The Chairman's fatal ignorance on safety status

**🚨 Significance:**

On December 4, 2025, MC Chairman Tsui Man-kam admitted to the press he was "**unclear**" whether the critical fire safety repairs (approved Sep 29) had been completed before the fire. This admission reveals a fatal governance failure: the MC approved the $144,170 contract covering essential components like **inlet valves** and **fire bells**, but failed to monitor its execution. Consequently, when the disaster struck, the estate's top decision-maker did not know if the life-saving systems were operational or dismantled for maintenance.

**📜 Original Record:**

> **Evidence [A]: The Admission of Ignorance**
> *Source: Now News / 2025-12-04*
>
> "本台向業主立案法團主席徐滿柑查詢，他表示**不清楚該次的消防執修工程是否已經完成**。"

> **Evidence [C]: The Project Timeline**

>
> *Note: Just 19 days before the fire, the minutes were amended regarding this specific project (correcting the "Lift/Monthly" error), proving the project was fresh on the agenda.*

### 🆔 [E-SUPPRESS-2025-12-06-01] The Dismantling of Independent Archives

**🚨 Significance:**

Between December 3 and December 6, 2025, the independent civil investigation into the Wang Fuk Court fire was effectively neutralized through coordinated extra-legal pressure. Two prominent citizen investigators, **Hailey Cheng** (鄭曦琳, known as 'hmtwinter') and **Ellie Yuen**, simultaneously announced the cessation of their reporting on December 3, citing "accurate intelligence" and "force majeure" respectively.

By December 6, Cheng’s "Hong Kong Fire Documentary" (a GitHub-hosted evidence repository) was deleted (404). Cheng publicly attributed the closure to her being "busy dating Jungkook" (a member of BTS), accompanied by a "silence/oops" emoji (🫢). This resort to absurdity serves as a cryptic acknowledgment of coercion—signaling that the closure was involuntary but explicit protest was no longer possible.

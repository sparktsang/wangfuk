### 🆔 [E-ADMIN-2025-09-29] Zombie Governance: The "Lift" Contractor & The $1.7M Blunder

**🚨 Significance:**

Official records reveal that the Management Committee (MC) operated in a state of **"Zombie Governance"**, approving critical safety contracts without basic comprehension or scrutiny.

On September 29, 2025, the MC approved a tender for fire safety repairs. However, the minutes show they unanimously passed a document containing two fatal absurdities:
1.  **Wrong Profession:** They listed the fire safety companies as **"Lift Contractors"** (升降機承辦商).
2.  **Wrong Cost:** They approved the repair cost of **HK$144,170** as a **"Monthly Fee"** (每月費用).

**Logical Deduction:**
*   **The "Rubber Stamp" Proof:** If even one member had read the document, they would have asked why a "Lift" company was fixing fire hoses.
*   **The Financial Blindness:** If the figure was truly a "Monthly Fee," the annual cost would be **HK$1.73 million**—an astronomical figure for minor repairs. That no one questioned this implies the committee members were financially illiterate or simply not looking at what they were signing.
*   **The Conclusion:** This explains the disaster. A committee that cannot distinguish between a Lift Contractor and a Fire Contractor, or between a one-off payment and a monthly fee, lacks the cognitive capacity to monitor complex building safety.

### 🆔 [E-NEGLIGENCE-2025-11-07-01] The Paralyzed Water Network & The Fatal Maintenance

**🚨 Significance:**

On November 26, 2025, during the fatal fire, the estate’s fire hose system was effectively paralyzed, with reports indicating only one hose might have functioned. This failure is directly traceable to a series of administrative decisions made just 19 days prior.

**1. The "Profit-Driven" Maintenance Logic:**
Records show that the replacement of critical water gate valves (閘掣) was prioritized **not for fire safety compliance**, but to accommodate the waterproofing works of the general contractor, **Prestige Construction (宏業)**. The Clerk of Works (COW) explicitly stated that valves needed replacing "because the General Contractor needs to stop water intake to proceed with waterproofing." This implies that if there were no waterproofing contract (profit), the aging valves might have been left to rot.

**2. The Critical Gap:**
The decision to replace these valves was finalized on **November 7, 2025**. The fire occurred on **November 26**. It is highly probable that the water supply to the fire fighting system was suspended or the valves were dismantled for this "maintenance" at the exact moment the fire broke out.

**3. Systemic Collusion & Conflict of Interest:**
*   **The Consultant (Will Power / 鴻毅):** Acted as both the building inspector and the project manager, facilitating Prestige's winning bid. 
*   **The Contractor (Prestige / 宏業):** Their directors now face **manslaughter** charges. Despite the quotes from other companies, they were awarded specific fire tank valve repairs (Item 11.5) to "avoid warranty disputes," effectively locking the MC into their ecosystem.
*   **The "Double Agent" (Wong Chin Hang / 黃展鏗):** The Clerk of Works, theoretically representing the residents but hired via the Consultant, pushed for these specific repairs that facilitated the Contractor's workflow.
*   **The Silent Watchdog (Victory Fire / 宏泰):** As the fire system maintenance contractor, they secured the renewal contract in Sept 2025. Yet, it took the *General Contractor's* need for waterproofing in Nov 2025 to identify "aging valves" that Victory's annual inspection apparently missed or ignored.

### 🆔 [E-RISK-2024-11-15-09] The Insurance Boycott

**🚨 Significance:**

At the end of 2024, faced with major repair works at Wang Fuk Court, nine of Hong Kong’s ten leading insurers either refused to provide a quote or did not respond. This indicates that the insurance industry—armed with the most sophisticated risk models—has effectively classified the estate as uninsurable. Only China Taiping was willing to underwrite the project.

### 🆔 [E-CENSOR-2025-12-06-01] The Dismantling of Independent Archives

**🚨 Significance:**

Between December 3 and December 6, 2025, the independent civil investigation into the Wang Fuk Court fire was effectively neutralized through coordinated extra-legal pressure. Two prominent citizen investigators, **Hailey Cheng** (鄭曦琳, known as 'hmtwinter') and **Ellie Yuen**, simultaneously announced the cessation of their reporting on December 3, citing "accurate intelligence" and "force majeure" respectively.

By December 6, Cheng’s "Hong Kong Fire Documentary" (a GitHub-hosted evidence repository) was deleted (404). Cheng publicly attributed the closure to her being "busy dating Jungkook" (a member of BTS), accompanied by a "silence/oops" emoji (🫢). This resort to absurdity serves as a cryptic acknowledgment of coercion—signaling that the closure was involuntary but explicit protest was no longer possible.
